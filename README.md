# Goalz

This is the finished #WizardsInTech React workshop!

1. This is the finished version of the Goalz App!
2. Well almost there is a bug - currently we can simply click add goal without filling out our form and it will add a blank goal.
3. The challenge is:

- Prevent the user from being able to add a blank goal!

4. The first person to tweet me with a solution - it must be commited to a repo so I can check it out - will receive their choice of any on sale Udemy course.
